1. AppActivity generates too much data. Instead of storing network usage stats every 5 
seconds regardless of whether or not anything new has happened, only store if 
an app has done something new.
Basically, have a separate table - for each app, only store the last seen value. Then
whenever you're going to add a new value, first check if it's any different from
the last seen value for the app - add only if different (also update last seen value
if different).

Pros: Will reduce amount of data stored dramatically
Cons: Require 1 db access (1 read) if nothing has changed, and 3 (1 read + 2 writes)
db accesses if something has changed.

2. Need better metric to measure wifi quality than just signal strength. RSSI is not 
the best metric.

Need to do more reading for this.
